# Quality Metrics: 
An efficient Quality Managment Plan contains Quality Metrics. Quality Metrics are the measurements, they are used to measure the qulaity of the project. 
The below are the quality metrics that are used in measuring the quality :
1. Passed Test Cases %= (Passed Tests Number / Total tests executed) * 100 
2. Failed Test Cases % = (Failed Tests Number / Total tests executed) * 100
3. Fixed Defects % = (Defects that are fixed / Total Defects that are Reported) * 100
4. Accepted Defects % = (Defects that are accepted as valid by team/Total defects that are reported) * 100
5. Executed Tests % or Test Execution Coverage %=(Number of test runs / Total number of tests that needed to be run) * 100
6. Requirements Coverage = (Number of requirements that are covered / Number of total requirements)*100
7. Number of bugs per test = Number of total defects/Number of total tests 
8. Number of tests run per Period of Time = Number of test runs / Total time
9. Test Design Efficiency = Number of Tests that are designed / Total time
10. Bug Find Rate = Number of total Defects / Number of total test hours.

There are three levels of defects. They are :
1. High level defect- They are cause due to the errors in planning. Project Manager should take care of it.
2. Mid level defect- They are like bugs . When we combine differents parts into a single projects it may give errors . So we should perform enough tests.
3. Low levele defect - They are hardware that are relates to the software and can be eliminated by providing the reuire hardware.

## Quality Tools:
Some of the quality management tools are :
- Control Charts : Control charts are used to identify whether the process is stable or unstable and also whether they are in             boundaries.
- Benchmarking : It helps in comparing the present projects with similar project.
- Cost of Quality :It helps to know the cost spent for quality.
- Six Sigma : It helps in removing errors thus ensures the quality of management.
