## 9. Project Cost Management

Project Cost Management includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget. Following are major processes:
1. Planning Resources — It determines which resources (material,people,equipment) and in which quantities these should be used to perform project activities.
2. Estimating the Cost — It estimates costs of the resources required to complete the project approximately.
3. Cost Budget — It gives the individual overall cost estimate to work items.
4. Controlling the cost — It controls the changes done to the project.

The budget of the project is $1,449,996.The project manager will allocate the budget to each and every department accordingly based on the requirements by each department. 
26% of total budget is allocated to project management,7% for hardware and 38% for software.Most of the project budget is allocated for software developement.
